                <h4>About Us</h4>
                <p>Started December of 2005: Born out of necessity when Tom and Julia were building customs homes. When Huneke Homes found challenges with accurate engineering, and scheduling; they decided there was a need in the Engineering market. With office staff already in place with Huneke Homes, knowledge of engineering as well as experience Huneke was able to get into the engineering market. Tom's professional engineering license and background in Civil Engineering continues to bring in customers in need of residential engineering as well as light commercial design. The idea is to treat customers with care. Be aware of the cost to customers and service them well. The company is presently hiring very conservative engineers, and very aggressive sales force. The combination is hoping to catapult Huneke Engineering to one of the largest firms in the area in the coming years.</p>

                        <h4>Gravity</h4>
                        <p>Gravity loads consist of live loads and dead loads. The engineer determines the sizing of beams, headers columns, and footings for gravity loads. Some of the tricks of the trade are: 
                        Determine deflection, not just stress
                        determine the weight of the footing, not just the load on it
                        determine the horizontal load on the footing, not just the vertical load.

                        <h4>Wind Engineering</h4>
                        <p>Identifying property type, location, use group and wind loads are the first challenges when doing wind engineering. Once loads are applied, then the structural engineering begins. With the use of the prescriptive methods defined in the building code, and with tested materials used for designing shear in walls and moment resistance, the engineer picks materials that can resist the wind. </p>

                        <h4>Seismic Engineering</h4>
                        <p>Residential projects rarely need seismic engineering in the St. Louis area since wind is usually the determining factor. Commercial is a different story. A few years ago, no one cared about seismic design. Nowadays it is a major concern. Calculations and reports are required for plan reviewers before permits are awarded to begin construction.</p>

                    Tom with Huneke Engineering recently helped me on a home remodel. He walked me
                    through every step of the process. We removed 4 load bearing walls and replaced them
                    with beams. We also jacked up multiple sagging floors. The project was mired
                    with nuances and hurdles as it is an 1890's home. Tom was patient, professional and
                    informative. I have very high standards and am often difficult to please. Tom exceeded
                    my expectations and I am satisfied with the result of the project.
